## 3DViewer

- The program provides the ability to:
- Load a wireframe model from an obj file (vertices and surfaces list support only).
- Translate the model by a given distance in relation to the X, Y, Z axes.
- Rotate the model by a given angle relative to its X, Y, Z axes.
- Scale the model by a given value.
- The program allows customizing the type of projection (parallel and central)
- The program allows setting up the type (solid, dashed), color and thickness of the edges, display method (none, circle, square), color and size of the vertices
- The program allows choosing the background color
- The program allows saving the captured (rendered) images as bmp and jpeg files.
- The program allows recording small screencasts by a special button - the current custom affine transformation of the loaded object into gif-animation (640x480, 10fps, 5s)
